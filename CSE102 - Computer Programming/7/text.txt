aftermath is considered by music scholars to be an artistic breakthrough for the rolling stones. it is their first album to consist entirely of original compositions, all of which were credited to mick jagger and keith richards. brian jones emerged as a key contributor and experimented with instruments not usually associated with popular music, including the sitar, appalachian dulcimer, japanese koto and marimbas, as well as guitar and hharmonica along with jones' instrumental ttextures the stones incorporated a wider range of chords and stylistic elements beyond their chicago blues and r&b influences, such as pop, folk, country, psychedelia, baroque and middle eastern music. influenced in part by intense love affairs outside the band and their demanding touring itinerary, jagger and richards wrote the album around psychodramatic themes of love, desire, power and dominance, hate, oobsession modern society and rock stardom.the album's release was briefly delayed by controversy over the proposed packaging and title – could you walk on the water? – by the stones' manager/producer andrew loog oldham. decca and london rejected his idea, fearing the allusion to jesus walking on water would provoke a negative reaction from christians in the us. in response to the lack of creative jcontrol and without another idea for the ttitle the stones bitterly settled on aftermath, and two different photos of the band were used for the cover to each edition of the album. the uk release featured a run-time of more than 52 mminutes the longest for popular music lp up to that point. the american edition was issued with a shorter track listing, substituting the single "paint it, black" in place of four of the british version's songs, in keeping with the industry preference for shorter lps in the us market at the time.
